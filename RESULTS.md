## What was compared

Custom **execution-based translation eval** (Stage 5): each held-out `evaluation`-config payload is a
directed source→target translation; the model's output is extracted, assembled with the row's
`execution_engine`, compiled, and run against `expected_input_output_pairs`. 3,336 payloads.

| | Model | Run |
|---|---|---|
| **Base** | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct` | `evaluation-results/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-1707095` |
| **Fine-tune** | `tkeskin/qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-code-translation` | `evaluation-results/qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-code-translation-1707733` |

Both run with `--max-new-tokens 512`, `--temperature 0.2` (same budget = fair comparison). Fine-tune
trained with LoRA on `leetcode_instruct_train`; the eval set is built from the held-out
`leetcode_instruct_test` split, so there is no train/test leakage.

## Headline (n-weighted over all 3,336 payloads)

| Metric | Base | Fine-tune | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| pass@1 | 29.3% | **61.9%** | **+32.6 pts (2.1×)** |
| compile% | 59.6% | **84.5%** | **+24.9 pts** |

Every one of the 18 (source × target × difficulty) cells improved — no regressions.

## Outcome breakdown (full 3,336, from the `outcome` column)

| outcome | base | ft |
|---|---|---|
| passed | 977 (29.3%) | **2065 (61.9%)** |
| wrong_output | 1010 (30.3%) | 753 (22.6%) |
| compile_error | 1129 (33.8%) | 480 (14.4%) |
| redefinition | 198 (5.9%) | **0** |
| timeout | 22 (0.7%) | 38 (1.1%) |

- **`redefinition` → 0.** *What it is:* many problems take or return a linked list (`ListNode`) or a
  binary tree (`TreeNode`). The execution harness **prepends the canonical definitions** of those
  types to the program it compiles, so it can build the inputs and compare the outputs. If the model's
  translation *also* defines `ListNode`/`TreeNode`, the compiler errors out with a redefinition (C++) /
  duplicate-class (Java) error. That's a **contract mismatch, not a logic or syntax bug** — the
  translated code may be perfectly correct on its own — so we give it its own `outcome` bucket instead
  of lumping it in with genuine `compile_error`s. The base hit this on 198 rows; the fine-tune, having
  learned the walkccc convention (which assumes those node types already exist), does it on **none**.
- **Compile failures (`compile_error` + `redefinition`) more than halved:** 1,327 → 480 — the raw-count
  form of the compile% jump (60→85%).
- **`wrong_output` dropped too** (1010→753): more often correct, not just more often compiling.
- **Only `timeout` grew** (22→38): the over-generation signature — a subset emits slower/run-on code.

## Observations

- **Compile-gated thesis confirmed.** On compiled targets (→cpp, →java) the base lost most points to
  code that wouldn't build; the fine-tune learned the target-language idiom (walkccc style) and
  `compile%` jumped (e.g. cpp→java Easy 45.5→89.0; python→java Hard 13.6→50.8), pulling pass@1 with it.
- **java→python gained the most** (+44 to +60). The base already compiled Python ~100% but got the
  logic wrong; the fine-tune fixed correctness there, not compilation.
- **Frontier that remains:** Hard tier + →cpp. python→cpp Hard is the floor (22.7%, +8.4 — smallest
  gain). C++ is the hardest target, Hard the hardest difficulty.

## Discussion

- **Why is the fine-tune slower to generate? (open — not investigated.)** Phase-1 generation was much
  slower for the ft (the first eval run hit the 30-min wall; the re-run at 3h finished), and some
  outputs reach the 512-token cap. We have **not** determined the cause, and there are at least two
  explanations with opposite implications — we shouldn't claim either yet:
  - The ft may write **longer, more complete** solutions (the walkccc references it trained on are
    fuller than the base's terse output), so 512 tokens is simply too short for some. On this reading
    the *cutoff* is the limiter, not a model defect — and the base may finish fast precisely because it
    emits something short and wrong.
  - Or its **stop behaviour weakened** — it elaborates past the answer (we saw one sample invent
    unrequested helper methods, then truncate). That would be a mild regression addressable in training
    (e.g. EOS on the `output` field).
  The probe is cheap: look at the response-length distribution and check whether truncated rows are
  otherwise correct, and/or re-run with a larger `--max-new-tokens` and see what moves.
- **`timeout` 22→38 is execution, not generation.** This bucket is the *compiled program* running too
  long — a different axis from how long generation took. The uptick is small and uninvestigated (could
  be occasional non-terminating or slower generated code); noting it, not explaining it.

## Open (not yet measured — do NOT claim)

- [x] **`redefinition` outcome share** base vs ft — measured: 198 (5.9%) → 0. See outcome breakdown.
- [ ] **Other 4 models** (llama-3.2-1b, qwen-3.5-0.8b, gemma-3-4b-it, mistral-7b-v0.3) base vs ft —
      8 eval jobs queued; extend the matrix when they land.
- [ ] **(a) Did training work, traditionally?** Held-out perplexity base vs ft. Not run.
- [ ] **(c) General-ability regression?** lm-eval (mmlu/gsm8k/...). Benchmark track not set up/run.
- [ ] **(b) Standard code benchmarks** (HumanEval, MultiPL-E) for an external comparison point. Not run.
